## AutomataFastLoadPatcher
### What?
This program mods the Nier:Automata executable to remove the load screens and replace them with a blank screen.

### Why?
By default the game will display a loading screen with some text display.  
This screen will always play out in full even if the underlying asset loading is completed.  
This mod removes this so that the game will finish the load screen as soon as it's ready.

### How to use
Place the executable in your NieRAutomata install directory and run it by double clicking it. The program will mod the executable. Done!
